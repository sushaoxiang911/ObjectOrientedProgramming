/* Notes:
1. The messages are classified by which module's .cpp file prints them out.
You must follow this classification to be sure your modules behave like mine.

2. Two or more strings on the same line would be part of the same
line of output, with some variable value output between them.

3. If there is no actual constant non-whitespace text involved in an output statement, it
is not shown here. 

4. All error messages are actually printed out by p2_main. The unrecognized command error 
message can be printed out directly by p2_main if desired. But all other error messages are
used to initialize an Error exception object in the responsible module named below, and are
then printed out by the top-level catch block in p2_main.
